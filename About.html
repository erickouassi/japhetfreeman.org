                        <p>Japhet Freeman Institute of Public Health is a nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing public health practices and
                        making systematic improvements in population health. Japhet Freeman Institute of Public Health is a facilitator,
                        convener, and catalyst helping to bring about better health and well-being for all people and communities in Ghana and
                        Africa.</p>
                        <p>Skill development, leadership cultivation, and continuous learning are critical aspects of ensuring that professionals
                        in health-related sectors in our region are as effective as they can be. We serve as a resource for Ghana in creating
                        shared learning opportunities. This range from convening educational sessions on emerging topics that our communities
                        need to understand and address to providing more comprehensive training programs meant to develop a segment of the
                        healthcare workforce.</p>

                        <p>The institute is strongly committed to using epidemiologic methods to investigate the etiology of diseases in human
                        populations, and as well as utilizing epidemiologic approaches to evaluate health care delivery by advancing knowledge
                        concerning the causes and prevention of diseases and the promotion of sound health.</p>
                        <p>Our goal is to promote sound health and prevent disease in the population. Our team adopts a
                            population-based
                            perspective on pressing health issues, through health education campaigns, screening and
                            prevention programs,
                            epidemiologic analysis of health problems, and consideration of implications of health
                            policies.</p>

                            <p>In recent years, the emphasis in epidemiologic research has shifted from etiologic to outcome research. With the
                            introduction of novel, ground-breaking therapeutic approaches, based on recent discoveries in immunology and genetics,
                            researchers are now well positioned to study the effect of these therapies on long-term survival and quality of life.
                            It is also important to assess if appropriate treatment is equally administered to all the patients in need of such
                            treatment, or if the same racial/ethnic disparities observed in disease prevention and early detection persist in
                            disease treatment. The Japhet Freeman Institute is dedicated to using epidemiologic research to address the growing
                            interest in racial/ethnic/gender disparities in health and healthcare delivery.</p>
                            <p>Another key area of epidemiologic research Japhet Freeman Institute of Public Health will be committed to is the
                            comparative effectiveness of alternative treatments in real-life settings, where patients suitable for treatment belong
                            to a variety of ages and races, have a spectrum of comorbidities, and differ in insurance coverage. Evaluating
                            therapeutic approaches in such diverse segments of the population will offer an insight on the translation of new
                            discovery science into clinical practice.
                            At Japhet Freeman Institute, our purpose is grounded in our commitment to undertake projects that provide public
                            benefit, advance medical care and improve patient outcomes. Our belief is that all people deserve to live healthy lives,
                            have access to medicines that are safe, effective, and affordable.</p>
